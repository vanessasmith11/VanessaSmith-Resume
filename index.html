        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">English LiteratureðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Vanessa Smith, and I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside. I am studying and earning my degree as an English major with the hopes of becoming an impactful and skilled English professor at a university like my own. Iâ€™ve gained a lot of insight and experience from tutoring younger English students and practicing assisting them with various assignments and tasks. Iâ€™ve come to really enjoy analyzing and evaluating literature, but most importantly, I like to take that knowledge Iâ€™ve gained and transfer it to young students. Reading meant a lot to me growing up, and I believe that it shaped me into the person that I am today. I want children to learn to share that value with themselves and with each other. Learning to effectively read, pull information, and apply it to real life is a skill that can be found useful and beneficial every day. I look forward to having an impact on future generations and inspiring others to learn to love reading and literature.<br><br>

        I have always been very good with working with kids. Through my tutoring experience, I have learned how to be an effective teacher, and to help kids better understand the material they are working with. As a college student, I understand how frustrating it can be to misunderstand a book, or to struggle to grasp a concept. I have learned to greatly appreciate the assistance of my professors and teaching assistants. I have made it a goal to be that for other people, and to vicariously enjoy the satisfaction of figuring something out. It is rewarding to know that the kids Iâ€™ve helped have taken their new knowledge and understanding and applied it not only to their school work, but to their real life encounters with similar struggles or concepts. It is through these experiences as a tutor that Iâ€™ve learned to value the importance of learning, and from the perspective of a professor, being an effective teacher.<br><br>

        Aside from my interests and experiences within the English profession, I have also utilized my time as a college student to participate in clubs and activities that have made me a more well-rounded and suitable candidate for a position as a professor. In my undergraduate years, I have joined multiple clubs involving subjects outside of the English field with the hopes of refining my knowledge in other subjects in a way that might benefit me as an English professor. I joined a wildlife club called Our Blue Marble, which focused on the importance of being green and eco-friendly. I learned that itâ€™s the small things that add up and make a difference, and I have learned to better myself and be more kind to animals and to our planet. I also participated in an all-girlâ€™s fitness club, where I met motivated and inspired girls that taught me to be consistent, and to work every day toward my goals. I feel that these clubs made me into a better person, and I look forward to taking this into the workplace.
